      description: "Heartbreaker is the debut studio album by Ryan Adams, released on September 5, 2000. The album was recorded over fourteen days at Woodland Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. It was nominated for the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize. The album is said to be inspired by Adams' break-up with music industry publicist Amy Lombardi. According to Adams, the album's title originates from a poster of Mariah Carey: \"My manager called and said, 'You have 15 seconds to name this record, ' My eyes focused on this poster of Mariah wearing a T-shirt that said HEARTBREAKER. I just shouted, 'Heartbreaker!’\"'",
